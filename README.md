<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

#  Analyzing Customer Behavior and Predicting Churn in the Telecommunication Firm <a name="about-project"></a>

## Overview 

Machine learning is a vital tool for telecom companies to predict and mitigate customer churn. By analyzing data patterns, ML algorithms can anticipate customer behavior, identify dissatisfaction factors such as long wait times or rude service, and enhance self-service options. This proactive approach helps retain customers and maintain loyalty in an increasingly competitive and price-sensitive market.

## Data Sources 📊
- The dataset was provided in GitHub and SQL and was transformed to CSV format for transparency and reproductibility.
- Statistics on Telco Churn Rate.

## Topical Questions and Hypotheses
#### Questions 🤔:

ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS
The following analytical questions will help us gain insight and as well as confirm our hypothesis

1. How long Female and Male spent with Telco before Churning

2. What is the trend between Contract and churn

3. How long does it take each contract type before Churning

4. Which method of payment was prefered among the Senior Citizens and how much in total did both senior and non Senior citizens paid before churning

5. What is the churn trend for gender and dependents as well as their tenure

6. what is the trend between payment methods and gender and how it affect churning

7. What is the trend between tenure and paperlessBilling in relation to churn

8. What is the trend between tenure, Internet Service and senior citizen in relation to churn

9. What is the trend between StreamingMovies and senior citizen in relation to churn

10. How does internetService and OnlineSecurity affect churn

11. What is the trend between Contract and Payment Method in relation to churn

### Hypotheses 🔬:
#### A significance level (α) of 5% will used to perform all the hypothesis testing

The following hypothesis will be tested

1. The average number of churn for Female customers is greater than or equal to that of Male customers.

2. The average amount of TotalCharges for customers that churn is greater than or equal to those that did not churn.

3. The average number of tenure for customers that churn is less than or equal to those that did not churn

4. The average number of churn for customers that have Month_to_month contract is greater than or equal to those with 'One year' contract.

5. The average number of churn for customers that have Yes value for streamingTV is less than or equal to those with No values.

6. The average number of customers with dependents that will churn is greater than or equal to that of customers with no dependents.

7. The average number of churn for customers that have Yes values for seniorCitizen is greater than or equal to those with No values.

8. The PAYMENT METHOD does not influence customer churn

9. The average amount of TotalCharges for customers that churn is greater than or equal to those that did not churn
10. The average number of tenure for customers that churn is less than or equal to those that did not churn

11. The average number of churn for customers that have Month_to_Month contract is greater than or equal to those with 'One year' contract

12. Gender does not influence customer churn

13. The Internet service does not influence customer churn

## Analysis 🔍
- Utilizing Python and data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights.
- We analyzed funding trends by year, sector-wise funding distribution, top investors, geographical distribution, and funding rounds.

## Machine Learning Models and Hyperparameter Tuning
-   Gradient_Boosting
-	Random_Forest	
-	XGBoost	
-   Naive_Bayes	
-   Logistic_Regression	
-   Support_Vector_Machine	
-   Decision_Tree	
-   K-Nearest_Neighbors	





## Findings 📈
- Total Charges and Tenure are highly positively correlated
- Customers that did not churn are more than those that churned.
- There are approximately 4000 non senior citizens among the telcos' customers compared to around 500 seniors
